# GenPardy
A new take on Jeopardy...may the best generation wins!

When game starts user will see a title and Genpardy game board
Game board will be a flexbox with padding with columns that represent categories of questions 
Categories will be on top row and will be fixed 
Boxes with $ amounts will be under the categories 
When User clicks on box, box flips and reveals a new box with a question 
Box will have a text box where you would answer the question-if correct, the corresponding amount gets added to score. Prompt says "Correct" 
If incorrect, the corresonding amount gets deducted from score. Prompt says "Incorrect" 
Game will continue until each box is blanked out. 

Limitations were the answer textbox- Everytime I tried to execute that and my running score, my gameboard would shrink down to a small box. 

I would like to add on to this game by incorporating more questions and making those questions appear randomly. Additionally, I would like to add another player and incorporate functions that give a more personalized experience based on the generation the user is a part of (ie by asking their birthdate and then showing prompts based on that)
