## Acknowledgments
- Inspired by Jeopardy, the classic quiz show.
- Generational trivia questions curated from various sources.
- Limitations were the answer textbox- Everytime I tried to execute that and my running score, my gameboard would shrink down to a small box. 

I would like to add on to this game by incorporating more questions and making those questions appear randomly. Additionally, I would like to add another player and incorporate functions that give a more personalized experience based on the generation the user is a part of (ie by asking their birthdate and then showing prompts based on that)

Enjoy the game and have fun exploring the trivia across different generations!
